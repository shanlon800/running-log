The Running Log provides runners a place to store information on their daily runs and compare past performances. After the run is completed, a runner can add a new run to The Running Log, or edit or delete an existing run. There is a dashboard which provides runners a snapshot of their current week as well as important metrics such as total miles, total time ran, and their pace for the runs. Runners can join a team of their friends and set a collective weekly mileage goal. On the team view page, the team can view each others progress using the Google Charts API. I also used technologies such as a React, Rails, Postgres SQL, Devise, OAuth, and Carrierwave.

I am an avid runner, but have never been able to use consistently any existing run tracking apps. I built the Running Log in order to be able to look at my past runs and view my performance for those weeks. I have friends who run as often as I do and I wanted to create a page where we can keep track of one another as well as set a common goal for all of us to work towards.
